The **Pragma** serie was born with an idea in mind: keeping it a simple instrument, putting at the bone some characteristics, enhancing the structural core. This serie uses the same body design either for 6 and 7 string guitars, than for 4 and 5 string basses: the neck pocket stills the same for the whole serie, which consists of a rectangular box on the body insert.

Made with the idea of having a *pragmatic* instrument, it results in a hassle-less design either for the builder than for the player: a stable bolt-on neck, fixed headless bridge, a diapason of 640mm for guitars and 854.5mm for basses, with two humbucker configuration. 

A versatile instrument, in the idea of plug, play, and enjoy!
