The linea **Verso** relies on the idea of an asymmetric shape, where the body is studied to garantee a better playability. 
Asimmetric shape and complementary contrasts are the key for these models, where the ergonomic *function* is the base that yields for the shape of the instrument, resulting into an innovative instrument for eclectic players.
