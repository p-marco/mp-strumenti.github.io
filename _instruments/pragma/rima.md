RIMA is a 6-string guitar tailored for Riccardo.

It had to be versatile, for it we choose to install a coil tap on the Tone pot, in order to guarantee a complete set of sounds. In addition to the classic 3-positions pickup switch, a kill switch found place in the electronics.

The choice of wood yields for a mellow tone with a lot of sustain, and the guitar spaces from classic rock sounds to jazzy vibes, alongside to fusion and funky possibilities.

The walnut top adds clarity to a well balanced instrument in terms of frequencies, while the mahogany core equilibrate it with their basses and sustain.
