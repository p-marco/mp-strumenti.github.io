A seven-string guitar without compromises. Thought for being fast and comfortable for shredding and rookie-lickings, the **LORE** shines in rock and progressive genres.

With a 650mm diapason and the neck-thru construction in wenge-cherry-maple, the envelope of the notes yields for a bright attack and quite a long sustain.

Made for being comfortable to play, focused on rock-oriented scenario, the use of Megaswitch based electronics gives a large opportunity in tone.
