I love this guitar.

It's not perfect at all and it has a lot of flawes, but it's my first *real* project in guitar building. I had the opportunity to start working on it with Alberto, an awesome senior woodworker, which gave me a lot of help, sharing with me his ideas and his *time*, above all.

I started it when I was 17, while it waited for the final refinements after my MA. Then, in 2015 I finished it (well, neverending actually) and I was happy to move with it in Czech Republic when I lived there.

Nothing more to say: it's not perfect but I love it, as life I guess.
